# Week-01-Assignment

Refelection:

Things I found easier:

- Understanding the different position properties and how they relate and using flexbox within the console to postion various elements on my page.
-

Things I learnt creting the webiste:

- how the max-width property works at a basic level. As I used it in conjunction with the width property to make the cta-container as scalable as possible for mobile.
- Intergrating and embedding symbols into html to add social media icons using font awesome.
- the scroll behaviour property to make links jump smoothly between each other.

Things I found diffiuclt:

- Choosing the right css unit rather than just using px so that my website was as mobile freindly as possible. I looked at REM,vh/vw and % mostly but found it difficult when condensing the viewport - this might be something to improve upon with media queries?
- Splitting elemements with multiple class attributes correctly. I found in my css although I got the correct styling I had several classes like my cta-container that had several properties making it hard to read through my code effectivly.
- Finding a way to make the background images scale to the website instead of cutting off on smaller resolutions.
